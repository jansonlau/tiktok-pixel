TikTok Pixel Sample App with Advanced Matching and Bulk Events Using Events API

Run the app by opening index.html. 

TikTok Pixel is a tool that allows businesses to track user activity on their website and create custom audiences for advertising purposes.

The code is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and consists of a function that loads the TikTok Pixel code on the webpage and multiple functions that track various user activities such as adding items to the cart, removing items from the cart, displaying the cart, and submitting a purchase. The code also includes functions for tracking additional user activities such as adding items to the wishlist, clicking buttons, and searching.

The pixelBatchAddress variable holds the address for sending batch pixel events to TikTok API. accessToken and pixelCode hold the access token and the pixel code for TikTok Pixel. These values must be updated with the appropriate values before the code is deployed.
